## 💡 Inspiration

For the longest time, my system for saving important links was… WhatsApp. 😅

I'd send articles, tools, and resources to myself which I thought was an easy way to save things for later. Unfortunately, while "saving" these links was easy, finding them later was always a nightmare. 

So I started building Re-Source — a smarter, more intentional way to quickly save and organize links📚
