## 💡 Inspiration

Re-Source was born out of a real need: I constantly saved links — articles, tools, videos, and notes — only to forget about them or lose track entirely. My old system? Sending them to myself on WhatsApp. It worked… until it didn’t. Important links got buried, and the ones I actually needed were frustratingly hard to find.

This app is my solution to that chaos — a smarter, more intentional way to capture and organize links so they’re not just saved, but actually useful when I need them most.
